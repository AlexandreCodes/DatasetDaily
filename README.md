# Dataset Daily

[Dataset Daily](https://www.datasetdaily.com) is a community of data junkies. Dataset Daily sends a dataset on Monday with analysis throughout the week. This repository is meant for the data and code snippets that go on throughout the week.

## Getting Started

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install pandas scipy numpy requests plotly matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras fbprophet
```
For additional information on installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation), and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html)
