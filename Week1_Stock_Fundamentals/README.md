# Dataset Daily

Dataset Daily is an email list that receives analytics updates throughout the week. This repository is meant for the code snippets and analysis that go on throughout the week to build the models. 

## Getting Started

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install pandas scipy numpy requests plotly matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras fbprophet
```
For additional information on installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation), and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) 

If you do not wish to use Anaconda, the following should satisfy the requirements: 
```
pip install pyex pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
